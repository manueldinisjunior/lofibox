A web music player to listen chill lofi songs


I love to listen songs, specially chill music songs while coding. I have seen many of my friends who codes, also love to listen chill songs like lofi songs. So I got an idea to build a music player specially to listen lofi songs.


As I am leaning web development, I sytarted building that lofi player using web technologies such as ReactJs, SCSS, etc.
